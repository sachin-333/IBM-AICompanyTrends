# AI-Driven Exploration and Prediction of Company Registration Trends with Registrar of Companies (RoC)

## Overview
Welcome to the "AI-Driven Exploration and Prediction of Company Registration Trends with Registrar of Companies (RoC)" project repository. This project uses AI techniques to explore and predict trends in company registrations based on data from the Registrar of Companies (RoC). The code in this repository helps you perform data analysis, preprocessing, visualization, predictive modeling, and model evaluation.

## Dependencies
Before running the code, you'll need the following dependencies installed on your system. Don't worry if you're new to Python or data science - we'll guide you through the setup.

### 1. Python
You need Python installed on your system. We recommend Python 3.7 or later.

#### Installation
- If you don't have Python installed, download it from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

### 2. Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter Notebook is a user-friendly interface for running Python code.

#### Installation
- Install Jupyter Notebook using pip (Python's package manager):
  ```bash
  pip install jupyter
  ```

### 3. Required Python Libraries
We use several Python libraries in this project. You can install them using pip.

#### Installation
Run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Running the Code
Now that you have the required dependencies installed, let's run the code step by step. We've organized the code into a Jupyter Notebook file, "AI_Project.ipynb," which makes it easy to interactively execute each section.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, you'll need to get the code from this repository to your local machine. If you're new to version control, you can download the code as a ZIP file from the GitHub repository.

1. Click on the "Code" button on the repository's main page.
2. Choose "Download ZIP" to save the code to your computer.

### Step 2: Open Jupyter Notebook
Now, you'll use Jupyter Notebook to run the code.

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory. You can do this using the "cd" command. For example:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/project-directory
   ```

3. Start Jupyter Notebook by entering the following command:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Your web browser will open to the Jupyter Notebook interface. You'll see a list of files and folders in your project directory.

### Step 3: Open the Notebook
Find the "AI_Project.ipynb" file in the Jupyter Notebook interface and click on it to open the notebook.

### Step 4: Run the Code
The code in the notebook is divided into sections. Each section corresponds to a specific analysis task. Here's a brief overview of each section:

- Analysis 1: Dataset Overview - Load and view the dataset.
- Analysis 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing - Example of handling missing values.
- Analysis 3: Descriptive Statistics - Summary statistics for numeric columns.
- Analysis 4: Visualizations - Generate various visualizations to explore the data.
- Analysis 5: Grouping and Aggregation - Example of aggregating data.
- Analysis 6: Correlation Matrix - Visualize the correlation matrix.
- Analysis 7: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) - Perform PCA for dimensionality reduction.
- Data Splitting and Model Training - Prepare data and train the model.
- Model Evaluation - Evaluate the model's performance.
- Hyperparameter Tuning - Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters.

You can execute each section step by step by clicking on the code cell and pressing "Shift+Enter" on your keyboard.
